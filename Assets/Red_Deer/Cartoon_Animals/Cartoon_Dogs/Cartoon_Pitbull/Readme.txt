Hello!

Thank you for choosing my asset!

This asset has a model with animations. 
Movement animations are presented in two types: in place (ending in _IP) and root movement (ending in _RM). 
Animations that involve cycling are divided into a start, a cycling part, and an end to make it easy to customize.


Before you start creating a controller or using another one, WATCH all the animations (especially for jumps). 
Jumping up animations have 3 start options (up looking up, forward up, up in place), 2 options for flying (moving with a forward slope (ends with "_F"), 
moving with a vertical slope) and 3 options for landing (forward, vertically down, vertically down with finishing steps). 
Also, a separate jump down and the end of the jump by climbing.


The animator controller is missing, as are the other scripts.

If you have any suggestions on the model, questions or problems with my models, write to me by mail, I will answer within one day:
